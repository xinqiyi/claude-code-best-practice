| 2 | MEDIUM | Note | Drops empirical SKILL COLLECTIONS star floor from 21k to ~15k. No explicit star-threshold memory exists for this table (only AGENT COLLECTIONS and CROSS-MODEL WORKFLOWS have the 10k+ rule), so this is a precedent-setting addition rather than a rule violation | COMPLETE (decision logged) |
| 3 | LOW | Note | Repo is cross-tool by design (supports Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor + 8 more per its own README description). Candidate for CROSS-MODEL WORKFLOWS table in future review, but classified here per user direction | COMPLETE (cross-classification noted) |
