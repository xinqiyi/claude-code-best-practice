## Frontmatter Fields (16)

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | No | Display name and `/slash-command` identifier. Defaults to the directory name if omitted |
| `description` | string | Recommended | What the command does. Shown in autocomplete and used by Claude for auto-discovery |
| `when_to_use` | string | No | Additional context for when Claude should invoke the skill — trigger phrases or example requests. Appended to `description` in the listing and counts toward the 1,536-character cap |
| `argument-hint` | string | No | Hint shown during autocomplete (e.g., `[issue-number]`, `[filename]`) |
| `arguments` | string/list | No | Named positional arguments for `$name` substitution in command content. Accepts a space-separated string or YAML list — names map to argument positions in order |
| `disable-model-invocation` | boolean | No | Set `true` to prevent Claude from automatically invoking this command |
| `user-invocable` | boolean | No | Set `false` to hide from the `/` menu — command becomes background knowledge only |
| `paths` | string/list | No | Glob patterns that limit when this skill is activated. Accepts a comma-separated string or a YAML list. When set, Claude loads the skill automatically only when working with files matching the patterns |
| `allowed-tools` | string | No | Tools allowed without permission prompts when this command is active |
| `disallowed-tools` | string/list | No | Tools removed from Claude's available pool while this command is active. Clears when you send your next message. The inverse of `allowed-tools` |
| `model` | string | No | Model to use when this command runs (e.g., `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`) |
| `effort` | string | No | Override the model effort level when invoked (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`) |
| `context` | string | No | Set to `fork` to run the command in an isolated subagent context |
| `agent` | string | No | Subagent type when `context: fork` is set (default: `general-purpose`) |
| `shell` | string | No | Shell for `` !`command` `` blocks — accepts `bash` (default) or `powershell`. Requires `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL=1` |
| `hooks` | object | No | Lifecycle hooks scoped to this command |
